# Multi-class-Classification-using-CIFAR-10

We will solve a multi-class classification problem using CIFAR-10 dataset which has 32x32x3 color images, each having one of the ten categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). We will use 50,000 images to train our convolutional neural network and 5000 images to test how well our convolutional neural network can recognize the correct label category.

Batch Size = 512 , Optimizer = Adam
Learning rate = 0.0001 , Initialization = Xavier Normal
Regularization = L1_L2 , Dropout probability = 0.25
